### Databases! 
* Relational databases
    * PostgreSQL
* Document databases
    * MongoDB

* We want to replace our current file with a document database using MongoDB!
* We are going to use `mongoose` as a library to interact with MongoDB.
* A `schema` is the `blueprint` that tells to mongoose how our `model` looks like.
* `__v` is the version of your record! You can compare your versions before you make an update.
* `addToSet`
