* Friendly intro about how the web works! :D
    * DNS Server
    * IP Address
    * Port
* Express: It gives node.js the capability to build a web server in a nice and easy way.
* `__dirname` gives you full path to the directory where the file where `__dirname` is used is.
* **View**: Its a perspective into your backend-system (e.g. a view into the data that you have in your database).
    * An understanding, a perspective into your data.
    * A dynamic way to create HTML files on the go.
    * HTML are dynamically generated depending on the data that you inject.
* `pug` => Template engine that we will be used.
* `pug` files are our views!
* Use `GET` when you want to _fetch_.
* Why can't we use `GET` to add new people to our DB? 
    * Because we are _writing_ something!
* Next week we'll use a real DB (MongoDB)

## Homework
* Take your current application and make it a web application! in such a way that we can interact with it through the browser (like we did in class today!)
* Check out the `final` branch of the `wtmbjs-4` repository and go through the changes
* Think about the application that you will build for graduation!
