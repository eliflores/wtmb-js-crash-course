Today we worked on our homeworks (e.g. completing them, making progress, etc.)
We also started our projects for Graduation and / or made some progress on them.

I thought this would be a good moment to go again over the steps to create your node project. 

## Steps
1. Run `npm init` and enter the required info!
2. Since we are using express, run `npm install express`
